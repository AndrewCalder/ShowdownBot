# ShowdownBot
A bot for Pokemon Showdown made using C# and the WatiN library.

##Requirements
The bot may require .NET framework 4.0 in order to run. This may not be the case in the future, but for now it is. Installer Soonâ„¢

##Getting started
Before running the program, be sure to edit the botInfo.txt file. The file contains the following parameters.
* username - Name of the bot's account.
* password - its password.
* owner - This is the name of your account. Technically, it's the name of the account who the bot will challenge
* site - The website the bot opens up. It defaults to the showdown website, but alternatives running the same software should be compatible (as long as they're formatted the same way) [Temporarily removed].

To start the bot, use the command **start**. This will attempt to log in as the specified user in the config.
If you leave an account logged in on the browser, you can use **startf** to skip the login/logout process.

Once the bot has been started, you will need to change it's state.

##States
The bot is controlled through manipulating various states. They are:
* Battlerandom - Initiates a Random Battle.
* BattleOU - Initiates an OU battle
* Idle - The bot waits for further instruction
* ChallengePlr - Challenges a specific player (unimplemented)

Currently, both battlerandom and battleou are set to challenge the "owner", instead of battling on the ladder.

The state can be changed with the command **changestate** and any of the above parameters. As an example, to change state to BattleOU type:
> changestate ou

Changing state within a battle may have unintended consequences, and for the time being should be avoided.

##Modes
The bot has different AI modes that determine how it will battle.
* Random - The bot will pick moves at random. It will not switch pokemon until one has fainted.
* Bias - The bot will pick a random move based on the predetermined weight for each moveslot.
* Analytic - (Unimplemented)

To change the mode, enter the **mode** command followed by the parameter (random / r, bias / b). ie.
> mode b

Modes can be changed amidst a battle.

##Other commands
* info - Displays the bot's current mode and state.
* kill - Stops the bot.
